# RECIPES SITE - REACT

This app, written with the React JavaScript framework, retrieves data from an existing recipe database and displays it in a user-friendly way. It uses modern ES6 features and is divided into small components that are easy to test and maintain. Some of the main components include service-context, error-boundary, error-indicator, spinner, and high-order components.

The main functionalities are:
- Display a random recipe with ability to navigate to the recipe page
- Sign up for emails
- Choose recipe from list and view its ingredients and instructions
- Start, pause, and continue a timer for a recipe
- Submit contact form
